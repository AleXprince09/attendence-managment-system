i use html to create register page and login page using dependencies in which i add spring.data.mongodb to store data.
You are using Bootstrap for most of the styling, but some additional custom styles are included for layout tweaks (e.g., centering the form and adding box shadow).
The form has a light background with rounded corners, and the buttons are styled using Bootstrap classes.
A simple link to the registration page is included as a placeholder (#).
